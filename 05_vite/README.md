# Vite

Last but not least we are going to talk about Vite. [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) is a web development build tool that allows for lightning-fast serving of code due its native ES Module import approach. If you're interested in learning more about Vite you can check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlAJokQ7nho) I did on it that covered my first impressions.

Vue projects can quickly be set up with Vite by running the following commands in your terminal.

```
npm init vite-app <project-name>
cd <project-name>
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Note: I asked Evan if Vite would ever replace Vue CLI...
