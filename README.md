# 5 ways to get started with Vue 3

Are you interested in getting started with Vue 3 but not sure where to start? Do you want to play around with Vue 3 without having to learn what a toolchain is? If you answered yes to either of those questions you are in the right place.

In this tutorial, I am going to give you 5 ways to start writing Vue 3 applications today. We will create some pretty trivial applications but my hope is that from them you will learn about all of the options at your disposal. Each of them have pros and cons and I will tell you about them as we go.

If you're looking for an overview on all the new features of Vue 3 this isn't it but don't worry I got you covered. I will include a card here and a link in the description below to a presentation I gave called **[Vue 3: Smaller, faster and stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmdKqXP8JR8)**.
