# Using a CDN

Vue is a progressive framework which means you can incrementally adopt it. If you have an existing application that you want to add Vue to simply drop in a CDN. This allows you to sprinkle in Vue and add interactivity to your application without buying into the whole toolchiain.

For prototyping or learning purposes, you can use the latest version with:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
```

> Note: For production, they recommend linking to a specific version number and build to avoid unexpected breakage from newer versions.
